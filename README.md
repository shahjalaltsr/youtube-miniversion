This "mini-YouTube" app easily handles data. It pulls information from an API, shows lists of items, and tells you if there's no content. You can click buttons to see what's active, and it smartly displays different things based on conditions. You can also see data in a pop-up window, search for content, and you'll see a loading spinner while it fetches data. Basically, it's super flexible for whatever you need to build!
